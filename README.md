Users have been presented with a User Interface where they are able to view, add new posts and comments.


A Tip button is provided which enables users to support another user’s post by donating them in Ethereum Coins. Admin page contains features to change minimum contribution and view the DAO admins.


The Organization is self managed by the users where the management team is chosen by voting from the users. User’s data gets stored on Ethereum Blockchain, which provides additional security and privacy over the traditional centralized systems, and hence, is safe from any unauthorized access or modification by anyone.

Going through some of the features of the User Interface, the first and the landing page is our home page which contains the form to create a new post, below that all the posts posted so far are shown. On the left, we  have a navigation bar to navigate between home page, profile page, admin page.

We can also click on any post, and it will take us to individual post page, which shows the text (caption) as well as the image associated with the post, the hash shown above is the hash of the author of this post, we are modifying this to the username, it  also contains the tip button to tip this post using ethereum coins, and comment button to add comments to this post.






### 3. Comments on a Post

Adding comments on a post is similar to posting posts, just write your comment and post it. We can also add image(s) to any comment and click on submit to add that comment. These comments will be stored in the comments array.

### 4. Voting Page

The voting page consists of four fields: ongoing election candidates, ongoing de-election candidates, previous election results, and previous de-election results.

The users can give their votes as a ‘yes’, by clicking the thumb up button, during an ongoing election and a de-election as well. In the same manner, they can use the thumb down button as a ‘no’. The majority of the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ counts would decide the results of the election and de-election processes. The final results can be seen in the election results section.

The current time for the election or de-election has been set to 30 seconds. This can be changed according to users’ requirements in the future.

We can  also tip a post, by clicking on the ‘tip this post button’. After clicking, we will be redirected to the page shown in the figure 5.6, we have to choose the tipping amount and then click the ‘Donate' button.

Now, since tipping a post takes the transfer of ethereum coins, the meta mask will be activated and it will ask for confirmation of the transaction. Once we confirm the order, ethereum coins will be transferred to the author's account.

### 6. Admin Page

We also have an admin page which will contain ‘change minimum contribution amount’, ‘view all DAO admins’, and ‘delete a post’ options.


‘Change minimum contribution amount’ option can change the min tip amount authorized by the admin, ‘view all DAO admins’ shows the list of all the DAOs which are elected through an election, and ‘delete a post’ option deletes a particular post of user’s choice.


### 7. DAO Admins List

When clicked on the ‘view all DAO admins’ button, we will be redirected to this page. Since on blockchain everything has a hash, the list hash of DAO is also shown.

### 8.1. Upload Post

This is the basic and most important feature of our platform, i.e. to add posts, a simple form is provided to add text and images in our post, and we can simply click on the submit button to add the post.

### 8.2. Upload Post

Adding a post also adds data on the blockchain, which means we have to pay the gas fee in ethereum, so the meta mask will be activated to ask for confirmation  of the transaction.



### 8.3. Upload Post
